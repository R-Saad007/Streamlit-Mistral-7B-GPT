## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system. You'll also need sufficient computational resources to run the Mistral 7B model (recommended: 16GB+ RAM, GPU optional but recommended).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R-Saad007/Streamlit-Mistral-7B-GPT.git
   cd Streamlit-Mistral-7B-GPT
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration settings
   ```

5. **Initialize the vector database**
   ```bash
   python setup_database.py
   ```

### Quick Start

Launch the application with a single command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

## Usage

### Basic Interaction

1. **Start the Application**: Navigate to the local URL after running the Streamlit command
2. **Upload Documents**: Use the sidebar to upload PDF documents or connect to your document repository
3. **Ask Questions**: Type your queries in the chat interface
4. **Review Responses**: The assistant will provide contextually relevant answers with source citations

### Advanced Features

**Document Management**
- Upload multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Automatic text extraction and chunking
- Real-time indexing and vector storage updates

**Query Optimization**
- Use specific keywords for more targeted results
- Ask follow-up questions to dive deeper into topics
- Request citations and source references for transparency

**Session Management**
- Conversation history is maintained throughout the session
- Clear chat functionality for starting fresh conversations
- Export conversation logs for record-keeping

### Example Queries

```
"What are the key requirements for client onboarding?"
"Explain the compliance procedures for new accounts"
"What documentation is needed for KYC verification?"
```
